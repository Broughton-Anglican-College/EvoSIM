# EvoSIM
An application which simulates a multitude of observed behaviours in nature, including genetic evolution, pred vs prey dynamics.

# Evolution Simulation

## 🧬 Description  
Describe the purpose of your simulation (e.g. natural selection, trait adaptation, predator-prey dynamics, etc.), key features (e.g. real-time visualisation, trait mutation, generational statistics), and what makes it unique or interesting.
The purpose of my EvoSIM application is to have three functioning simulations which allow for the user to interact with and watch predator vs prey dynamics, the lotka voltera mathematical model, in conjunction with how genetic traits evolve over time to increase surival chances in a specific environment.

## 🚀 How to Use  
_How users interact with the simulation._  

- Launch the simulation from your terminal.
- Use the input boxes to define:
  - Number of starting creatures
  - Maximum population
  - Respawn rate of food
- Click **Start** to begin the simulation.
- Observe real-time updates in the simulation window and the graph tracking average traits (e.g. speed, size, vision).
- Click **Stop** or **Reset** as needed.
