# EvoSIM
An application which simulates a multitude of observed behaviours in nature, including genetic evolution, pred vs prey dynamics.

# Evolution Simulation

## 🧬 Description  
Describe the purpose of your simulation (e.g. natural selection, trait adaptation, predator-prey dynamics, etc.), key features (e.g. real-time visualisation, trait mutation, generational statistics), and what makes it unique or interesting.
The purpose of my EvoSIM application is to have three functioning simulations which allow for the user to interact with and watch predator vs prey dynamics, the lotka voltera mathematical model, in conjunction with how genetic traits evolve over time to increase surival chances in a specific environment.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions  
Step-by-step setup guide for running the project locally.

1. **Download the Repository**  
   Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it to any location on your computer.

2. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   install external library "pygame" by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If trouble with `requirements.txt`, install pygame manually:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame 
   ```

3. **Run the Simulation**  
   Double-click `FinalVersion.py` to start the simulation, or run it from the command line:

   ```bash
   python FinalVersion.py
   ```

4. **Optional:** Modify Parameters  
   You can adjust simulation settings (e.g. number of creatures, food respawn rate) using the GUI input boxes or by editing values in the source files.

## 🚀 How to Use  
- Launch the simulation from your terminal.
- Read through the tutorial to understand application controls
- Click **Start** to begin your desired simulation.
- Observe simulation data and live visualisations.
- Click **Stop** or **Reset** as needed.
- Click **Download** to save the sims data as a png of the displayed graphs.
